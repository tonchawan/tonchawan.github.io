    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is Chawalwat (Ton) Poosawatrattana,
        I am a graduate of King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang Engineering Major in Aeronautical Engineering and Commercial Pilot.
        
        After graduation, COVID-19 was an epidemic in Bangkok and more districts nearby. So I decided to head back to my hometown and work as a Mechanical Engineering in Udonmaster tech industrial for a year. 
        
        I have a chance to learn and practice SQL language with my friend, and also self-study about databases, python, and R. For now I am preparing to change my carrier path, and do a part-time job as a cafe manager.</p>
